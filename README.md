# Blonglore-Home-Pricing-Project

# I'm thrilled to unveil my latest project: a Bangalore home price prediction model built using machine learning!

This project empowers users to estimate the value of potential properties with ease. By analyzing key factors like area, number of rooms and bathrooms, and location, the model provides valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the Bangalore real estate market.

Tech Stack Breakdown:

Jupyter Notebook: Fueled the exploration and analysis of data to create a robust model.
PyCharm: Transformed the model into a user-friendly Flask server, making it accessible online.
VS Code: Built the beautiful and interactive front-end web interface for seamless user interaction.
This project showcases my expertise in:

Machine Learning Model Development
Flask Server Deployment
Front-End Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
